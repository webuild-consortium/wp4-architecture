## About
The Conformance Specifications define how WE BUILD participants implement wallet interfaces and communication protocols between issuers, wallets, and relying parties (RPs). 
They ensure interoperability and conformance by translating ADR decisions into precise implementation requirements.

The ITB will be based on the CS as a starting point. The test suites in the ITB are relying predominantly on the CS. 

## Contributing

The Architecture group define the CS, with help from all implementing participants (wallets, issuers and verifiers). For members of the consortium, find more information on the CS processes are held on [open social - Architecture Group](https://portal.webuildconsortium.eu/group/architecture).
