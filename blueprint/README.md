# WE BUILD – Architecture & Integration Blueprint (D4.1)

The **Architecture & Integration Blueprint (D4.1)** provides the strategic, high-level framework that connects the detailed architectural decisions (ADRs) and conformance specifications (CSs) into a unified view of the WE BUILD architecture.

It is maintained by the [Blueprint Coordination Group](https://github.com/orgs/webuild-consortium/teams/blueprint-coordination-group).

## Purpose
The Blueprint synthesises approved ADRs and CSs to:
- Maintain architectural coherence across WP4 and the Large-Scale Pilots.
- Provide a simplified, strategic view of the architecture for external stakeholders.
- Support traceability between governance artefacts and implementations.

The Blueprint synthesizes the outputs from the various WP4 capability groups (e.g. Semantics, Wallet Providers, Trust Registry, Testing, PID/LPID, QTSPs) to ensure interoperability and traceability across all components.

The Blueprint integrates the requirements and findings gathered from WP2 and WP3 use cases (stocktaking and pilot design phases) to ensure that architectural decisions and conformance definitions serve actual implementation needs.

## Responsibility
The **Blueprint Coordination Group** ([@webuild-consortium/blueprint-coordination-group](https://github.com/orgs/webuild-consortium/teams/blueprint-coordination-group)) is assigned responsibility for maintaining and approving the Blueprint content.  

 **Specifically, the group shall:**
- Review and approve incoming ADR pull requests that affect architectural scope or integration requirements.  
- Ensure that approved ADRs and CSs are consistently reflected in the Blueprint.  
- Maintain the Blueprint as a living document and coordinate updates across WP4 capability groups.

The Blueprint thus serves as the single, high-level reference for the project’s architecture — simplifying governance and ensuring traceability between architectural reasoning (ADRs), implementation specifications (CSs), and the overarching project framework.

## Relation to Other Processes
- [Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)](../adr/README.md) capture architectural reasoning and decisions.  
- [Conformance Specifications (CSs)](../conformance-specs/README.md) define technical implementations and interoperability rules.  
- The Blueprint consolidates both into a single reference architecture.

The Blueprint is not a parallel process - it consolidates the architectural reasoning captured in ADRs and the implementation definitions established in CS documents into a single, strategic reference.
