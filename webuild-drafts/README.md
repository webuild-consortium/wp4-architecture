# Drafts / Work in Progress

This folder contains notes, exploratory material, and ideas that are not yet mature enough to be included in the official Blueprint, ADRs, or Conformance Specifications.

## Guidelines
- Each file should focus on a single topic or experiment.
- Clearly indicate authorship at the top of the file.
- Include date/version for tracking evolution.
- When a draft becomes relevant, it can be moved to the appropriate Blueprint section or become a Conformance Specification.
- Keep drafts concise; avoid copying entire documents.
