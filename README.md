## About
[Architecture decision records](adr/README.md) are lightweight architecture decision records (ADR) for each software-related decision affecting interoperability.

[Conformance Specifications (CS)](/conformance-specs/README.md) ensure interoperability and conformance by translating ADR decisions into precise implementation requirements.

[The Architecture & Integration Blueprint (D4.1)](/blueprint/README.md) provides the strategic, high-level framework that connects the detailed architectural decisions (ADRs) and conformance specifications (CSs) into a unified view of the WE BUILD architecture.

[WE BUILD Drafts](/webuild-drafts) are work-in-progress material and contains notes, exploratory material, and ideas that are not yet mature enough to be included in the official Blueprint, ADRs, or Conformance Specifications.

## How to Work with Issues

All discussions, feature requests, and proposals should be initiated as GitHub Issues.  

- **Labels:** Use `draft`, `blueprint`, `adr`, `cs`, `question`, `discussion` etc.
- **Assignment:** The owner of the issue is responsible for driving it forward. External groups may comment and suggest edits.
- **References:** Link related ADRs, Conformance Specs, or Blueprint sections in the issue description.
- **Workflow:** 
  1. Create issue
  2. Assign owner(s)
  3. Add relevant labels
  4. Conduct discussion in comments
  5. When ready, attach PR linking to the issue
  6. BCG-team review and merge according to branch protection rules

During its lifetime, an issue can lead to a number of different outcomes:
- A question is answered without further action.
- A question is answered and leads to clarifications in various documents.
- An activity to produce a decision basis is agreed upon.
- A decision is made and a change to the architecture documentation is decided.

Within each issue, everyone can contribute opinions and proposed solutions.
